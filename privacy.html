                    This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application
                    ("Hereditas") collects, uses, and protects personal data
                    when you use our art and monument recognition service. By

                  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

                  <h3>Personal Identifiers</h3>
                  <p>
                    When you create an account, we collect your email address
                    and authentication credentials. You can register with
                    email/password or via third-party providers (Google or
                    Apple). If you use Google or Apple login, we receive basic
                    account information (name, verified email) to authenticate
                    you. We do not collect passwords from those services, and we
                    do not collect government IDs or phone numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> Your username
                    and avatar image are publicly visible to all users of the
                    App. This information is displayed on your profile and can be
                    viewed by anyone using the App, regardless of whether they
                    follow you or have access to your scans.
                  </p>

                  <h3>User Photos and Discoveries</h3>
                  <p>
                    The core function of the App is to recognize artworks,
                    monuments, and cultural sites from photos. When you take or
                    upload a photo, the App collects and uploads the image for
                    analysis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each photo (a "discovery" or "scan") is stored securely in
                    your user profile together with the location where the
                    photo was taken, which helps improve recognition accuracy
                    and allows you to revisit your discoveries later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The location is collected via your device's location
                    services at the time of capture (with your consent). If you
                    disable location access, the App can still work but
                    recognition and record accuracy may be reduced. We do not
                    derive or store location data from metadata in other photos
                    without your permission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Photos and their associated recognition data (description,
                    date, and location) are stored permanently in your profile
                    until you choose to delete them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Account Privacy Settings:</strong> You can choose to
                    set your account as either public or private. Public
                    accounts allow all users to view your scans and discoveries.
                    Private accounts require you to approve follow requests
                    before other users can access your scans. Once you approve a
                    follow request, that user can view your scans and
                    discoveries.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Social Features</h3>
                  <p>
                    The App includes social features that allow you to follow
                    other users and be followed by others. When you follow
                    another user, you can view their public scans or, if their
                    account is private, you can send a follow request. If a
                    private account accepts your follow request, you will be
                    able to view their scans and discoveries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We collect information about your follow relationships,
                    including who you follow and who follows you, to enable these
                    social features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Content you choose to make visible to other users (such as public scans, discoveries, and profile information) may be viewed, shared, or saved by those users outside of the App (for example, via screenshots or screen recordings). We are not responsible for how other users handle content that you choose to make publicly accessible.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Automatic Device and Log Data</h3>
                  <p>
                    We collect limited technical information for security and
                    operations, including:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                    <li>Device type and operating system</li>
                    <li>App version and timestamps</li>
                    <li>Error or crash logs</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This information helps ensure service reliability and detect
                    abuse. It is not used for advertising or behavioral
                    profiling.

                  <p>
                    We use collected information to operate, maintain, and
                    improve the App:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Recognition and Explanations: Your photo and its
                      location are processed through AI recognition to identify
                      the artwork, monument, or site and to generate an
                      explanation.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Profile History: We store each discovery - including its
                      photo, explanation, and location - in your user
                      profile. The visibility of this content depends on your
                      account privacy settings (public or private).

                    <li>
                      Social Features: We use your profile information, follow
                      relationships, and account privacy settings solely to enable social interactions within the App, such as following other users, approving follow requests, and viewing scans based on privacy settings. Follow relationships are not used for behavioral profiling or personalized advertising.

                    <li>
                      Authentication and Account Management: Your identifiers
                      (email, Google/Apple ID) are used to authenticate your
                      account, send password resets, and ensure security.

                    <li>
                      Support and Operations: Device and log data are used to
                      monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and prevent
                      abuse.

                    <li>
                      Improvement: We may analyze aggregated, anonymized data to
                      understand usage trends (e.g., most recognized monuments).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Advertising: We use Meta and TikTok to track anonymized interactions

                  <p>
                    We integrate a few essential third-party providers to power
                    the App's features:

                      and its location to OpenAI's API for AI recognition
                      and explanation. OpenAI also provides text-to-speech
                      services to convert explanations into audio narration.
                      OpenAI does not use API data for training and retains data
                      for up to 30 days solely for abuse monitoring.

                      cloud infrastructure (AWS or GCP). Data is encrypted in

                      approved can view your scans and discoveries. You have

                    You can change your account privacy settings at any time in

                    restrict access to your scans, but users who were already
                    following you will retain access. Changing from private to
                    public will make all your scans visible to all users. We do not disclose private account content or follow-request data to other users unless you explicitly approve access through your privacy settings.
